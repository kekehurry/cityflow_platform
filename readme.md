# CityFlow Platform üëã 

**To Create Smarter, More Sustainable Cities**

CityFlow is a low-code, AI-enhanced platform designed to assist urban analysts and researchers in creating workflows for data analysis, urban evaluation, and simulation. With integrated AI module builder and collaborative case-based system, CityFlow enables users to search and create workflow through natural language inputs, making it easier to discover, share, and refine innovative approaches for urban problem-solving.

**üî• Updates: [CityFlow Launcher Released!](https://github.com/kekehurry/cityflow_platform/releases)**

## Quick start with CityFlow Launcher

CityFlow Launcher offers a user-friendly interface for the installation, operation and update of the cityflow platform. You can download the lateset version in the [release page](https://github.com/kekehurry/cityflow_platform/releases)

## Install with Docker üê≥

Alternatively, you can also install cityflow platform using docker command:

```
docker run -d --name cityflow_platform -p 3000:3000 -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ${PWD}/temp:/cityflow_platform/cityflow_executor/code ghcr.io/kekehurry/cityflow_platform:latest
```

Cityflow plaform relies on [cityflow_runner](https://github.com/kekehurry/cityflow_runner.git) to execute python and react modules. The docker container will automatically pull the latest cityflow_runner image. You can also pull it manually before the init process:


```
docker pull ghcr.io/kekehurry/cityflow_runner:latest
```
